# SupplychainDashboard
Project Title: Supply Chain Management Dashboard Development & Analysis
Descriptive Analysis:
Performed data aggregation of 46K products sold across multiple suppliers and regions to generate key metrics like average price, total revenue, and product sales by type (skincare, haircare, cosmetics).
Visualized manufacturing lead times, production volumes, location-based lead times, and revenue distribution across different cities (Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi) to identify high-traffic regions.
Analyzed supplier performance through defect rates, lead times, and shipping costs across various supply chain stages.

Predictive Analysis:
Forecasted shipping costs based on lead times using regression trends observed in the “Shipping Costs by Lead Times” chart, helping anticipate future transportation expenses.
Predicted future product sales and production volumes based on historical data trends from product categories like skincare, haircare, and cosmetics, with maximum sales forecasted for skincare.
Used supplier performance trends to estimate future lead times and defect rates, supporting supplier selection and contract negotiations.

Diagnostic Analysis:
Identified the correlation between lead times and production volumes, observing that higher lead times (20–30 days) often result in higher production outputs, which helps in understanding bottlenecks.
Investigated defect rates by suppliers, finding that Supplier 2 had the highest defect rate and longest lead times, signaling a need for process improvement or supplier evaluation.
Diagnosed cost patterns by analyzing shipping costs by lead times, where shorter lead times were associated with reduced shipping costs, suggesting inefficiencies in longer-duration shipments.

Prescriptive Analysis:
Recommended a cost optimization strategy by encouraging suppliers to reduce lead times, which could lower shipping costs (e.g., costs drop from $46.90 to $6.78 as lead times decrease).
Suggested improvements in supplier relationships, particularly with Supplier 2 and Supplier 1, to mitigate defect rates and improve overall delivery times based on performance analysis.
Proposed a focus on skincare products due to their high sales volume, driving marketing efforts and inventory planning toward the most popular category.
